# Radar-Using-Arduino

Radar is a long-range object detection system that uses radio waves to establish certain parameters of an object like its range, speed and position. Radar technology is used in aircrafts, missiles, marine, weather predictions and automobiles. This Arduino Radar Project is based on Sonar technology which uses an ultrasonic sensor to determine the presence of any object in a particular range. It is implemented with the help of Processing Application. The information collected from the Ultrasonic Sensor with the help of Arduino is passed to the Processing Application where a simple Graphics application is implemented to mimic a Radar Screen. This can be implemented as a surveillance system.
